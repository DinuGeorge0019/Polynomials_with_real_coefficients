# Polynomials_with_real_coefficients
This project contains modules for evaluating arithmetic operations with polynomials.

Contains the following features : 
- addition of two polynomials 
- substraction of two polynomials 
- multiplication of two polynomials
- division of two polynomials 
- rise to a given power
- evaluating a polynomial with a given number
- returning a given coefficient
- printing the given polynomial

# For educational purpose there are two expresion evaluated :
- expresion 1 : E1 = P1^2(x) - P2(x) * P3(x)
- expresion 2 : E2 = (P1^2 - P2 * P3)(x)
For the given expresion the result should be the same. P1, P2 and P3 are three given polynomials, x is a given value for evaluation.
